# Pareidolia attention test
This is a test I saw on a research, tried to make it with python for fun.  
It has problems; noise images should countinue after face, Pareidolia face or object shown.   
Original test had tulip and daisy picture and question before every question.  
This is not made for research. It's made for fun and should'nt used for research at this level at any means.  
Made with Pygame
